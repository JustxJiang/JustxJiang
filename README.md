### Little More About Me  

It takes me a while to warm up to others. I love strawberries and most strawberry flavor foods. I love biking, volleyball, music, and video games. I also read a lot of manhwa (if you want any recommendations ask contact me :D). I'm a team player when it comes to projects/groups. I am new to all this and am planning to make my owns project in the near future.

Here's one of my favorite songs 🎤:- [**Everything Goes On by Porter Robinson**] (https://youtube.com/watch?v=BNMKGYiJpvg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEFVxI9lqjU)
